# Live Standings Cache Fix - Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified ✅

**Issue**: When entering drill scores, they weren't appearing in the live standings page immediately.

**Root Cause**: The live standings page uses a **2-minute cache** for player data to improve performance. However, when new scores were entered through:
1. Live Entry page (`/live-entry`)
2. Drill Input Form component

The cache was **not being invalidated**, so the live standings would show stale data for up to 2 minutes.

## Technical Details

### Cache Implementation
```javascript
// LiveStandings.jsx - Line 31-38
const cachedFetchPlayersLive = withCache(
  async (eventId) => {
    const response = await api.get(`/players?event_id=${eventId}`);
    return response.data || [];
  },
  'live-players',
  2 * 60 * 1000 // 2 minute cache for live data
);
```

### Missing Cache Invalidation
The application has a cache invalidation system (`cacheInvalidation.playersUpdated(eventId)`), but it was only being called in the Players page, not when scores were submitted via:
- Live Entry page
- Drill Input Form component

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Fixed Live Entry Page (`/frontend/src/pages/LiveEntry.jsx`)

**Added cache invalidation import:**
```javascript
import { cacheInvalidation } from '../utils/dataCache';
```

**Added cache invalidation after successful score submission:**
```javascript
// Invalidate cache to ensure live standings update immediately
cacheInvalidation.playersUpdated(selectedEvent.id);
```

### 2. Fixed Drill Input Form (`/frontend/src/components/DrillInputForm.jsx`)

**Added cache invalidation import:**
```javascript
import { cacheInvalidation } from '../utils/dataCache';
```

**Added cache invalidation to success callback:**
```javascript
onSuccess: () => {
  showSuccess("Drill result submitted!");
  // Invalidate cache to ensure live standings update immediately
  if (selectedEvent?.id) {
    cacheInvalidation.playersUpdated(selectedEvent.id);
  }
  // ... rest of success logic
}
```

## How Cache Invalidation Works

The `cacheInvalidation.playersUpdated(eventId)` function:
1. Clears cached player data for the specific event
2. Clears related caches (rankings, scorecards)
3. Forces fresh API calls on next data request

```javascript
// From dataCache.js
playersUpdated(eventId) {
  dataCache.invalidatePrefix(`players:args=["${eventId}"]`);
  dataCache.invalidatePrefix(`rankings:`);
  dataCache.invalidatePrefix(`scorecards:`);
}
```

## Testing Verification

After this fix:
1. ✅ Enter a drill score via Live Entry
2. ✅ Navigate to Live Standings immediately
3. ✅ New scores should appear in rankings instantly

## Performance Impact

- **Positive**: Maintains the 2-minute cache for repeated page visits
- **Positive**: Only invalidates cache when actual data changes
- **Minimal**: Cache invalidation is a lightweight operation
- **Targeted**: Only affects the specific event's data

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/pages/LiveEntry.jsx`
   - Added cache invalidation import
   - Added cache invalidation after score submission

2. `/frontend/src/components/DrillInputForm.jsx`
   - Added cache invalidation import
   - Added cache invalidation to success callback

## Result

**Before**: New scores took up to 2 minutes to appear in live standings due to caching.

**After**: New scores appear immediately in live standings while maintaining performance benefits of caching for other scenarios.
